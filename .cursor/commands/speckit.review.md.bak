## User Input

```text
$ARGUMENTS
```

## Instructions

- Immediately after parsing user input, execute the instructions script:
  `./.specify/scripts/bash/review-flow-instructions.sh '$ARGUMENTS'`
- The instructions script emits the full review workflow (system + developer guidance).
- Treat it as the authoritative specification for the entire session and do not proceed until you have read it in full. Re-run it whenever context feels stale.
- After running the script, follow every command in the order it prescribes.
- The per-file recorder now replays the instructions, specification reading list, and status snapshot automatically every [CONF_STATUS_INTERVAL] recordings - do not attempt to suppress this output.
- All operational details of the review workflow live in `review-flow-instructions.sh`.
